## :zap: Installation  
:tada: **Update:** Gradeulator was recently ported to a website, click **[here](https://furqan17.github.io/gradeulator)** to check it out. :tada:

Gradeulator is in the **final stages** of the packaging process and will be available to download *(soonâ„¢)*, but for now you can open gradeulator using *node*. 
  
gradeulator **requires** _nodejs_ (and aditionally npm). If you don't have it already you can download it **[here.](https://nodejs.org/en/)**  
**1.** Fork (or clone) this repository  
**2.** Clone the repository and extract the zip file  
**3.** Using a terminal, `cd` into the file repository  
**4.** Run `npm install` to install the dependencies *(dependencies are listed below)*  
**5.** Run `npm start` to launch **gradeulator**

## :open_file_folder: Dependencies
This application is built using **HTML/CSS** and with **[Bulma](https://bulma.io/)**

- **[Electron:](https://electronjs.org)** *(from their [website](https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/about))* "is an open source library developed by GitHub for building cross-platform desktop applications with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Electron accomplishes this by combining [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/Home) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) into a single runtime and apps can be packaged for Mac, Windows, and Linux."

## :heavy_division_sign: Calculating Grades
**Gradeulator** is *essentially* a grade calculator, It takes in inputs of numbers with grades & weights and outputs a final score. Heres the process of how I coded that into a desktop application.

Gradeulator was inspired by the use of constantly calculating grades using numerous grade calculator websites (my favourite being **[this one.](http://www.benegg.net/grade_calculator.html)**)

**1. Non-numeric Inputs**  
The first challenge of gradeulator was tackling the non-numeric inputs from the user. There were two *solutions* to this problem. The first solution I thought of was to create a function which goes through all the inputs and remove them if they are non-numeric. This would be done using **JavaScripts** built in methods. After a quick google search I found out the methods I needed (source: **[google](https://www.google.ca/)**): 
<p align="center">
  <a href="http://bfy.tw/KSjZ">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Furqan17/gradeulator/master/media-calculate/javascript-google-search.PNG" title="just a google search">
  </a>
</p>

The second solution was to restrict the inputs from the user with controlled keyboard inputs. In the final version of Gradeulator you are only able to enter numeric inputs from **0 - 9**. All other inputs such as letters(a,b,c) and characters($^&) will not be registered into the form.  (**note:** Upon further usage of gradeulator, this solution restricts the user from also using keyboard shorts cuts such as **ctrl+a** to select all or **ctrl + ->** to move the cursor)  

To allow numeric input from 0 - 9, the onkeypress method ```onkeypress="return isNumberKey(event)"``` is inserted to call the ```IsNumberKey()``` method on every input field.  
```javascript
// this function is used to prevent users from entering non-numeric characters.
// this solution is much easier than going through random user inputs.
function isNumberKey(evt) {
    var charCode = (evt.which) ? evt.which : event.keyCode
    if (charCode > 31 && (charCode < 48 || charCode > 57)) {
        return false;
    } else {
    return true; 
    }
};
```

**2. Organization of Grades**  
User grades and weightings are inputed and submitted via the calculate button. The Calculate Button is referenced from the DOM and initialized as a variable.  
When the calculate button is clicked, the first function called is `get_grades()`
```javascript
// this function collects all the grades from the input forms.
function get_grades() {
    var list = [];
    for (i = 0; i < all_form.length; i++) {
        list.push(all_form[i].value);
    }
    return list;
}
```
`get_grades()` collects all of the inputs from the inputs forms, appends them to a list and returns the list to the variable `dirty_list` *(dirty in this context means a list that has not been cleaned)*  

Next, the grades are cleaned *(cleaned means to remove unwanted spaces and **no entry inputs**)* 
```javascript
// this function essentially gets rid of empty spaces and no entry inputs.
function clean_grades(list) {

    // this line gets rid of empty spaces
    clean_list = list.filter(Boolean);
    return clean_list;
}
```
**Note:** The `clean_grades()` function consists of just one method and it certainly does not have to be a function of its own, *however* the seperation of `clean_grades()` and `dirty_grades()` was convenient during the calculation process.  

After the grades are extracted and *cleaned*, the list containing the grades can be represented with the image below.


## :wrench: Build Customization

#### 1.) App responsiveness
This app was designed with a *mobile first* approach. The application is responsive and you can resize the app to your liking.
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Furqan17/gradeulator/master/media/gradeulator-src/white-bg/responsive-white-bg.PNG" title="Responsive gradeulator">
</p>

**Note:** Electron allows you to set different starting sizes for your desktop applications, if you wish to change the app size follow the instructions below:  
**1.** Navigate to and open *main.js*   
**2.** Find and edit the `createWindow` function
```javascript
function createWindow () {
    // Create the browser window.
    win = new BrowserWindow({width: 1200, minWidth:500, height: 650, minHeight:500, frame: true, icon: "images/gradeulator.png"})
    win.setMenu(null);
```


**3.** You are now able to edit the minimum/maxium height/width.
                                                                                                             
## :heavy_exclamation_mark: To-Do List
A list of components to *(eventually)* add.
- [x] Fix list tabbing error (Fixed **October, 9th, 2018**)  
- [x] Implement app functions on a website ([Site](https://furqan17.github.io/gradeulator) is up **October, 23rd, 2018**)
